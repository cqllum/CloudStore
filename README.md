- **Automatic Replication** - Configurable file replication across multiple storage brokers (this can be replicated in settings)
- **Smart Load Balancing** - Intelligent file distribution based on broker usage and availability
- **User Management** - Complete authentication system with admin controls
- **Virtual File System** - Hierarchical directory structure with folder management
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Storage usage tracking and broker health monitoring
- **Web Interface** - Modern responsive UI for file management
- **RESTful API** - Complete API for programmatic access
- **Whitelabel Support** - Customizable branding and themes

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cqllum/Cloudstore
cd Cloudstore
```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv cloudstore-env

# On Windows:
cloudstore-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source cloudstore-env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure environment**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your settings:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-unique-secret-key-here
PORT=5000
DEBUG=False
```

5. **Initialize the database**:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will automatically create the SQLite database and default admin user.

6. **Access the application**:
   - Open browser: http://localhost:5000
   - Login with: `admin/admin`
   - Change default password immediately

### First-Time Setup

1. **Login as admin** and change the default password
2. **Add storage brokers** (Local storage is created automatically)
3. **Create regular users** if needed
4. **Configure system settings** (replication, themes, etc.)

### Production Deployment

1. **Set environment variables**:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"
export DEBUG=False
export PORT=5000
```

2. **Use production WSGI server**:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

3. **Set up reverse proxy** (nginx recommended)
4. **Configure SSL/TLS** for HTTPS
5. **Set up regular backups** of the SQLite database

## Architecture

### System Components
1. **Flask Web Server** - HTTP API and web interface
2. **SQLite Database** - Metadata storage and user management
3. **Storage Brokers** - Pluggable cloud storage adapters
4. **Replication Engine** - Automatic file distribution and redundancy
5. **Background Workers** - Broker health monitoring and maintenance

### Database Schema
- **users** - User accounts and authentication
- **brokers** - Storage provider configurations
- **files** - File metadata and virtual paths
- **file_replicas** - File location tracking across brokers
- **settings** - System configuration

### Storage Flow
1. File uploaded via API/UI
2. System selects optimal brokers based on load balancing
3. File replicated across configured number of brokers
4. Metadata stored in database with replica locations
5. Background workers monitor broker health

## Administration

### Admin Features
- User management (create, edit, delete users)
- Storage broker configuration
- System settings (replication count, refresh intervals)
- Storage usage monitoring
- Theme customization

### System Settings
- **Replica Count**: Number of copies per file (default: 2)
- **Broker Refresh**: Health check interval in minutes (default: 5)
- **Storage Limit**: Per-user storage quota (default: 5GB)

## Development

### Adding New Storage Brokers

1. **Implement CloudBroker interface**:
```python
class CustomBroker(CloudBroker):
    def upload_file(self, file_data, filename):
        # Upload implementation
        return storage_path
    
    def download_file(self, storage_path):
        # Download implementation
        return file_data
    
    def delete_file(self, storage_path):
        # Delete implementation
        pass
    
    def list_files(self, path=''):
        # List implementation
        return file_list
    
    def get_storage_info(self):
        # Storage info implementation
        return {'total': 0, 'used': 0, 'available': 0}
```

2. **Register in broker factory**:
```python
# In cloud_brokers.py
brokers = {
    'local': LocalBroker,
    'custom': CustomBroker,
    # ...
}
```
 

## Security

- Password hashing 
- Session-based authentication
- File access control per user
- Admin privilege separation
- Secure file upload handling

## Limitations

- 5GB storage limit per user (configurable)
- SQLite database (suitable for small-medium deployments)
- No end-to-end encryption (files stored as-is on brokers)
- Limited concurrent user support

FYI - currently this is a POC / beta product - encryption should be added and better distribution of secured areas on brokers should be introduced.
This shouldn't be used for anything sensitive, merely just a way to remove clutter on your own storage areas.

This goal here is to have a whitelabel solution that can be integrated into your own platforms (i.e hosting companies) and have sufficient user management whilst having good security practices.
I will continue to work on this over time but feel free to contribute, and also raise issues where you have a problem.

Also note that the architecture here (specifiaclly SQLite was to demonstrate and build the product quickly - production environments should and will not be using this on the release of that..)
